# day-of-my-life

 #### It is lab work for dyscret math, created by Nazar Parnosov

for my machine time is not so important and he almost does not rely on it. After all, during the day, I do not often rely on time. The information that I give to the functions is a chance and events are already happening or not happening relative to it.

It is my Finite State Machines for simulation a day of mu life.
